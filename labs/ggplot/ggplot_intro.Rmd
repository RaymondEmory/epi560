# Course Considerations: My Teaching Philosophy

.font150[* My goal: discourage adversarialism and foster mutualism in the classroom.]

--

.font150[

* My goal: promote a non-judgemental environment in which students comfortably **reveal their** strengths and **limitations**.
   * Have you ever thought about different types of questions you can ask?: [A Typology of Questions](http://www.phy.ilstu.edu/pte/311content/questioning/typology.html)

.font150[* My view: don't just read. *Understand!*
   * You should really consider watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3un_VbXVefk)
]

--

.font150[* Your goal: quickly and clearly articulate concepts succinctly and precisely, recognize and elaborate on nuances, and proﬁciently implement technical (coding) procedures in practical settings.
  * Have you watched the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3un_VbXVefk) yet?

.font150[* Major point we will not cover: practical (analytic) dimensions of any rigorous scientific approach cannot be separated from context. *Context matters.*]

# Course Considerations: How to Learn

# Course Considerations: How to Learn

.font150[

Much of the course content will be anchored in or associated with *code*.

* use it

* explore it

* break it

* fix it

* re-write it

* improve it

# R and General Coding Considerations

.pull-left[

Get the most recent version of R. For Windows and MacOS, install one of the *precompiled binary* distributions (i.e., ready-to-run programs) linked at the top of the R Project web page. 

Once R is installed, download and install R Studio, an "Integrated Development Environment" (IDE). It is a front-end program that enables us to use R more efficiently and effectively.


Install the tidyverse and other add-on packages for R. These will enable you to run the code provided in the course.

# R and General Coding Considerations

To install the tidyverse and other related packages, you need an internet connection and have to run RStudio. Type the lines into R's command prompt, located in the window named "Console." In the code on the side, the $\leftarrow$ is made up of two keystrokes: first < followed by a short dash, -.

The code below should be a good starting point for the course.


```{r, echo=T, eval=F, tidy=T, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80)}

packages <- c("tidyverse","skimr","here","remotes","boot","survival","GGally","gridExtra","rlang","haven","broom","Hmisc","gmm","VGAM","sandwich","lmtest")

install.packages(package, 
                 repos='http://cran.rstudio.com')


```

If you run into trouble ...

  what will you do once you've graduated and you run into trouble?
