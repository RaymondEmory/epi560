# Identifiability: Instrumental Variables and Local Average Treatment Effects

Average treatment effects (ATEs) are extremely common estimands in the empirical sciences. Researchers will often conduct randomized or observational studies, quantify treatment effects, and then interpret these treatment effects as ATEs. As we just encountered, the validity of this interpretation depends heavily on the above stated assumptions: counterfactual consistency, no interference, (conditional) exchangeability, correct model specification, and positivity. Each of these assumptions provides an opportunity for our causal interpretation to break down. 

This has prompted a large body of research to develop on both what happens when these assumptions do not hold, and what we can do about it. For example, when counterfactual consistency is violated, we can consider re-evaluating our exposure or research question, and examine the possible "versions of treatment" [@VanderWeele2009, @Hernan2011a]. When interference is violated, we can look to evaluate direct, indirect, and spillover effects, which are defined specifically for treatments that result in interference [@Hudgens2008]. Violations of the correct model specification assumption has lead to work on using machine learning for semiparametric or nonparametric causal inference [@Naimi2022, @Kennedy2016]. When positivity is violated, there are several options one can pursue to either mitigate its impact [@Petersen2012] or avoid the need for assuming positivity altogether [@Naimi2021, @Kennedy2019].
